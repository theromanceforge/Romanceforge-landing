# The Romance Forge

A choose-your-own-adventure romance engine powered by HTML, JavaScript, and future GPT integration.

## Structure

- `index.html`: Landing page
- `setup.html`: Story + tone selector
- `engine.html`: Story engine runner
- `scenes/`: Modular story content
- `main.js`: Engine logic
- `utils.js`: Parameter parsing

## To Run

Use Live Server or deploy to Vercel/Netlify. All files are client-side for now.

## Next Steps
