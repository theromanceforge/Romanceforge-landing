      <p>The hallway smells like old carpet and disinfectant. Room 312 is at the far end — the door with the peeling brass number and the flickering sconce above it. You hesitate with your fist raised, knuckles just shy of the wood. Then, you knock.</p>

      <p>The door opens faster than you expect. No chain. No hesitation. Just her — framed in the soft amber light of the room behind her. She’s barefoot, holding a half-empty glass of something dark. The case worker. The woman you swore you’d never see again.</p>

      <p>“Detective,” she says, like a question she’s already answered. Her voice is low and calm, but there’s that edge. You remember that edge. The kind that cuts in all directions.</p>

      <p>You step in. She doesn’t move to stop you. The door clicks shut behind you, and suddenly, it’s just you and her. The silence fills every inch of the room — and yet it’s louder than anything you heard today at the precinct.</p>

      <p>“I need to know why you called me,” you say, finally. Her smile doesn’t reach her eyes. “You always need something, don’t you?”</p>
